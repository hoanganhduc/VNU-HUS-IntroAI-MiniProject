### 🗒️ Summary
A self-supervised model trained to recognize cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Network.

### 🎯 Background
I'm fascinated by how AI agents can pick up patterns from data and make good predictions based on that.

### 🚀 Plan
- Dataset: Kaggle
- Pandas: read/write files
- NumPy: data processing, calculating
- CNN model: TensorFlow Keras
